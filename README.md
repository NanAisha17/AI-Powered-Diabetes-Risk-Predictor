## 🎯 Objective  
A Python-Excel tool that automates diabetes risk classification based on WHO guidelines, showcasing data cleaning, workflow automation, and clinical knowledge integration.
It’s designed to evolve into an AI-powered system with future patient data.

## Why it matters
Diabetes affects millions globally, and early detection saves lives. My tool demonstrates how users can assess their risk instantly via an Excel-Python dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

Data: Cleaned & analyzed with Excel (from Kaggle dataset)
Model: Python-powered prediction code
Deployment: Integrated with Excel using xlwings for user-friendly input

## 📁 Files Included  
- `diabetesRiskPredictor.xlsm` (Excel analysis and user interface)  
- `DIABETES PREDICTION.sql` (SQL queries)  
- `DiabetesRiskPredictor.ipynb` (Python AI model)
- `DiabetesRiskPredictor.py`

## 📊 Key Insights  
1. Patients with HbA1c >7.0 and BMI >30 are high-risk.  
2. Patients above 70years have the highest count of diabetes

## Keys
